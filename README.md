# ChatGPT Clone ðŸ¤–
This project is a clone of the ChatGPT application, built using React.js for the frontend and Express.js for the backend. It allows users to chat with OpenAI's GPT model via an API key. The user can select the model, tokens and temperature for the request. The project serves as a example of how to integrate OpenAI's GPT API into a web application.
